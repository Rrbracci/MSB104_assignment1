# **Data Acquisition**

# Downloaded file for population in DE (Germany), FI (Finland) and RO (Romania). Furthermore, we load up the file i RStudio by import the file in Library(readr). Moreover, we commended RStudio to read the file "demo_r_pjanaggr3_page_linear_csv". Additionally, we implemented the function na = "NA" for RStudio to read the missing values. Lastly, we added the function "show_col_types = FALSE" to prevent RStudio displaying the column data types while reading the file. 
library(readr)
demo_r_pjanaggr3_page_linear_csv <- read_csv("demo_r_pjanaggr3_page_linear.csv.gz", 
    na = "NA", show_col_types = FALSE)
```

```{r}
# First step was to rename the file for the assigned countries (DE, FI & RO). Furthermore, we utilized the function filter with str_sub considering a better overview of relevant dataset. Lastly, we were interested in population in every sub_regionals in the relevant contries. To receive and organise the relevant data, the function "Select" was used.
